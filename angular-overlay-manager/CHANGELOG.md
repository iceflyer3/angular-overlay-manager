## [2.0.1] - 2019-02-21
### Changed
Derped and forgot to update the Angular version used in the readme. npm won't let you upload the same version twice so here we are. This is exactly the same as version 2.0.0 except the readme now states the correct version of Angular that is in use. We'll be more careful about this going forward. You live and you learn.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-02-21
### Changed
Now uses and supports Angular 7.x

## [1.0.0] - 2019-01-27
Initial release
